# Stop-Signs-Detaction
A neural network model that detect "Stop-Signs"  using ""convolutional Neural networks "CNN" 

the project was written in jopyter notebook so it is best to open using it 

the "resize&rename file" reshape all the training samples to one size and change the names so that it is eaiser to itrate thought them 

the training samples are at a google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioQ5V3-MaKioybYhqBB0oEpw-uubBG2f/view?usp=sharing

the labeling software used is "https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg"
